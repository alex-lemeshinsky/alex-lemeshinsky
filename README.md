Hi!

I am eighteen years old student and flutter developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I am currently studying at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. I do not have any commercial experience working as a software engineer, but I want to develop my skills and build professional cross-platform apps.

I have learned Dart and Flutter for about 2 years and think that this is the best framework for cross-platform development. Before Dart, I learned other programming languages like Python and JavaScript, because I am interested in computers and programming since childhood.

Looking forward to your offers,

Alex
