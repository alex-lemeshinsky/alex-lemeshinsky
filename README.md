Hi!

I am eighteen years old student and Flutter developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I am currently studying at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. I have some commercial experience working as a software engineer and want to develop my skills in building professional cross-platform apps.

I have learned Dart and Flutter for about 2 years and think that this is the best framework for cross-platform development. Before Dart, I discovered other programming languages like Python and JavaScript, because I have been interested in computers and programming since childhood.

Looking forward to your offers,
Alex
